                A bipartisan US Senate resolution has recognised the McMahon Line as the
                international boundary between China and Arunachal Pradesh. The resolution sees Arunachal Pradesh as an
                integral part of India. China claims Arunachal as its own territory. Its belief in its claim is so
                strong that it often protests against visits by Indian leaders to border areas in Arunachal Pradesh.

                It's not often that America affirms India's stand on its border dispute with China. The resolution will
                certainly rile China. America's bipartisan articulation indicates a clear hardening of its stand against
                China but also possibly America's willingness to insert itself into border disputes between India and
                China and increase India-US military cooperation. Many see the resolution as a shift in America's
                position.

                But once the war started, then US Ambassador to India John Kenneth Galbraith forced America to shift its
                position in favour of India. “The McMahon Line is the accepted international border and is sanctioned by
                modern usage. Accordingly we regard it as the northern border of the region,” Galbraith said in a
                statement issued during the war. America continued to affirm India's position on the Arunachal border.

                Therefore, the recent bipartisan resolution by American senators is just a reiteration of its old
                stance.
